        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          CampusTrade was created by students for students across the Minnesota State system.
          It started with a simple idea — make it easier for college students to buy and sell textbooks
          directly with one another without overpaying at bookstores or waiting on shipping.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began as a class project quickly became a community-driven marketplace that helps
          thousands of students save money and connect across campuses. Whether you’re looking to sell
          last semester’s books or find affordable study materials, CampusTrade keeps things simple,
          local, and trustworthy.
        </p>
