Anthony notes 10/12/2025:

    - Initial templates created (CSS files, header/footer.php files)
    - LoginPage.php created (low fidelity)
    - Need to look into and start Object Oriented Programming for websites. Backend Logical components (controllers, models) 
    Examples:
      UserController: Handles user-related operations (login, logout, registration, profile updates).
      UserModel: Responsible for communicating with the database (CRUD for users).

    - For the backend. Folder structure needs to be established, maybe we need sub-folders for classes or functions. (Need to research and decide)
